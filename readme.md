# POLL TAPE COUNTER WITH GPT-4V

![Input a poll tape, get out a csv](input-output.png)


This project uses GPT-4V to count votes from poll tapes. Poll tapes are the printed results from voting machines, and this code processes images of these tapes to extract and tally the vote data.

The accuracy of the program depends on the quality of the input data and has not been evaulated at all â€” this is an experimental technology, use at your own risk!

It currently generates errors ~30% of the time, but those seem mostly to be when the image is too blurry to process. I expect you could update the schema to handle those cases.

All usages expect jpg images in the data directory. subdirectories within at least one level have been tested and work too.

Built on python 3.10.10.

Start by cloning this project.

## Instructions for Command Line Usage:
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Set the environment variable "OPENAI_API_KEY" with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
3. Run the script with the directory and number of images to process as arguments. For example: `python src/read_poll_tape.py ../data 10` processes ten images.
4. The csv will be saved to your working directory

## Instructions for using Python Notebook:
I recommend using the VS Code Jupyter extension.

1. set up virtualenv: `python -m venv libs`
2. `source libs/bin/activate`
3. Install req's: `pip install requirements.txt`
4. (If NOT using VS Code) run `jupyter lab` to start server
5. open `src/read_poll_tape.ipynb`
6. Run the cell containing `image_uris = load_image_uris()` to load all image URIs
7. Input your own OpenAI API key in the `get_transcription` cell
8. Run the cell containing `df, non_compliant_schemas = process_images()` to process all images, one at a time to reduce memory storage. [TODO: add multiple per call or go multi-threaded]
9. The processed data is saved in `df` and non-compliant schemas are saved in `non_compliant_schemas` (again, mostly blurry images but please review)
10. To save the processed data to a CSV file, run the cell containing `df.to_csv('processed_images.csv', index=False)` [TODO: de-dupe results somehow] [TODO: retry or recovery logic for non-compliant schemas or other errors].
